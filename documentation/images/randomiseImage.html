# randomiseImage function

## Overview

The `randomiseImage` function cycles through random images from a directory and displays them on the screen. The function chooses a random image from the directory, displays it on the screen, and then waits for a specified amount of time. The function repeats this process until all images in the directory have been displayed.

## Function Signature

```py
def randomiseImage(pixel_framebuf,
invalid_numbers: List[int],
delay: float = 1) -> None:
pass
```

## Parameters

- `pixel_framebuf`: A Neopixel pixel_framebuffer object to display the text and images on.

- `invalid_numbers` = `(List[int])`: A one-dimensional list of integers that the random number generated can't be. This stops the same images from being repeatedly chosen.

- `delay` = `float`: A float value representing the time to wait between each image being displayed on the screen. The default value is 1 second.

## Return Value

- `number` = `int`: An integer value of the number corresponding to the image displayed. This can be added to an array and passed again as an argument to stop the same image from being selected again.

## Function Description

The `randomiseImage` function chooses a random image from a directory and displays it on the screen.

The function starts by getting the file paths of all images in the given directory using the `os.listdir` function. It then creates a list of all the image paths by concatenating the directory path with the image file name.

The function then enters a loop where it chooses a random number between 0 and the total number of images in the directory minus 1 using the `random.randint` function. If the chosen number has not already been chosen before, the function displays the corresponding image on the screen using the `displayImage` function and waits for a specified amount of time using the `time.sleep` function.

The function then exits and returns the chosen number.

## Example Usage

```py
# Cycle through random images with a delay of 2 seconds
randomiseImage(pixel_framebuf, [1, 3, 9], 2)
```

In the example above, we call the `randomiseImage` function to choose a random image (that isn't $1$, $3$, or $9$) from a directory and display it on the screen. The function waits for $2$ seconds before exiting.

## Exceptions

- The `randomiseImage` function assumes that the `os.listdir` function is defined properly and can be used to get the file paths of all images in a directory. If this function is not defined properly, the function may not work as expected.

- The `randomiseImage` function assumes that the `displayImage` and `time.sleep` functions are defined properly and can be used to display images on the screen and wait for a specified amount of time. If these functions are not defined properly, the function may not work as expected.
